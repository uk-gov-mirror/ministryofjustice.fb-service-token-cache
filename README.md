# fb-service-token-cache

A stand-alone microservice providing a REST endpoint from which other Form
Builder platform apps (User Datastore, Submitter) can retrieve service tokens.

The authoritative source for tokens is a wrapper around `kubectl get secret`
calls, which use the `FB_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG` and `KUBECTL_*` environment variables
(see below) to construct the secret name and kubectl parameters. It will cache
successful calls in Elasticache Redis for SERVICE_TOKEN_CACHE_TTL seconds.

## Deployment

On merge to master tests are executed and if green deployed to the test environment. This build can then be promoted to production
